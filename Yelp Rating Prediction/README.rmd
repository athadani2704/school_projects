This project mainly performs Web-Scraping of reviews, ratings and much of other content from Yelp's website for three different cuisines - Italian, Indian and Japanese.
I have also placed a limit on how many reviews to extract (approx. 10K per cuisine). Kindly follow "Final project Summary.docx" file to get an idea of workflow of the project.
Although there are many different applications of the content I scraped but for this project I have focussed only on creating a predictive model to predict whether a user will like
a particular restaurant or not.
